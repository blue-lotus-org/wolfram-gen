# Contributing to Wolfram Gen

We warmly welcome contributions to Wolfram Gen! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or sharing your creative Wolfram Language generation ideas, your help is valuable.

Please take a moment to review this guide before submitting your contributions.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to Wolfram Gen:

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug, have a feature request, or find a mistake in the documentation, please open a new issue on GitHub. When submitting an issue, please:

* **Be clear and concise:** Describe the issue in detail.
* **Provide steps to reproduce:** If it's a bug, explain how someone else can reproduce the problem.
* **Include relevant information:** Mention your operating system, Wolfram Language version (if applicable), and any other details that might be helpful.
* **Check existing issues:** Before submitting a new issue, please search the existing issues to avoid duplicates.

### Suggesting Features

We're always looking for ways to improve Wolfram Gen. If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, please open a new issue and clearly describe your suggestion. Explain the problem it solves or the benefit it provides.

### Contributing Code

If you'd like to contribute code to Wolfram Gen, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the GitHub page to create your own copy of the repository.
2.  **Clone your fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wolfram-gen.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wolfram-gen.git)
    cd wolfram-gen
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username)
3.  **Create a new branch:** Create a dedicated branch for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
    ```
    Choose a descriptive branch name.
4.  **Make your changes:** Implement your feature, bug fix, or improvement.
5.  **Follow coding conventions:** Please try to adhere to the existing coding style and conventions used in the project. This helps maintain consistency.
6.  **Write tests:** If you're adding new functionality, please include relevant unit tests to ensure its correctness. If you're fixing a bug, consider adding a test to prevent regressions.
7.  **Document your changes:** Update any relevant documentation (e.g., README, docstrings) to reflect your changes.
8.  **Commit your changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add new feature X"
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    git commit -m "fix: Resolve issue with Y"
    ```
    Use prefixes like `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore` in your commit messages.
9.  **Push your changes:** Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
10. **Create a Pull Request:** Go to the main repository on GitHub and click the "New Pull Request" button. Select your branch as the compare branch and the main repository's `main` (or `master`) branch as the base branch.

    * **Write a clear and descriptive title and description for your pull request.** Explain the purpose of your changes and any relevant context.
    * **Reference any related issues** in your pull request description (e.g., `Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`).

### Improving Documentation

Clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial. You can contribute to the documentation by:

* **Fixing typos and grammatical errors.**
* **Improving clarity and conciseness.**
* **Adding missing information or examples.**
* **Translating documentation into other languages.**

Submit documentation changes through the same pull request process described above.

* **Open a new issue** to discuss your idea.
* **Contribute code** directly if you've already implemented it.
* **Share examples or snippets** in the issue or through other communication channels (if established).
